## Use Clustering to clean up author data

1. Split out the author names into individual cells using <code>Edit cells -> Split multi-valued cells</code>, using the pipe ( | ) character as the separator
1. Choose <code>Edit cells -> Cluster and edit</code> from the ‘author’ column.
1. Using the <code>key collision</code> method with the <code>fingerprint</code> Keying Function, work through the clusters of values, merging them to a single value where appropriate
1. Try changing the clustering method being used - which ones work well?
