## Episode 3 Key Points


- OpenRefine uses rows and columns to display data
- Most options to work with data in OpenRefine are accessed through a drop down menu at the top of a data column
- When you select an option in a particular column (e.g. to make a change to the data), it will affect all the cells in that column
- OpenRefine has a Records mode which links together multiple rows into a single record
- Split and join multi-valued cells to modify the individual values within them
- When creating multi-valued cells in your data, choose a separator that will not appear in the data values
