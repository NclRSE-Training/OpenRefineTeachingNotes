## Correct Publisher data

1. Create a text facet on the Publisher column
1. Note that in the values there are two that look almost identical - why do these two values appear separately rather than as a single value?
1. On the publisher column use the dropdown menu to select Edit cells->Common transforms->Collapse consecutive whitespace
1. Look at the publisher facet now - has it changed? (if it hasnâ€™t changed try clicking the Refresh option to make sure it updates)
